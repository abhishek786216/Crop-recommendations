# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System

This is a **Streamlit web application** that helps farmers and agricultural planners determine the most suitable crop to grow based on **soil nutrients** and **climatic conditions** using a machine learning model.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The app takes the following input from the user:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH value
- Rainfall (mm)

It then uses a **pre-trained Random Forest model** to predict the best crop to cultivate under those conditions.
